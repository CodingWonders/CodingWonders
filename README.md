Thanks to the power of an old, yet reliable, version of Visual Studio (Ultimate 2012); powerful and amazing products are being created.

### What am I up to?
- [DISMTools](https://github.com/CodingWonders/DISMTools), a free and open-source GUI for DISM operations
- [Code Backup Utility](https://github.com/CodingWonders/code-backup-util), a Power Automate flow designed to back up code files daily (**Past project**)
- [ix.io Uploader](https://github.com/CodingWonders/ix-uploader), a simple C# program designed to upload text files to [ix.io](http://ix.io) (**Past project**)

I'm also finding issues in other projects and trying to fix them. Some projects I've contributed to are:

- [WinGet packages](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs)
- [Windows Utility (formerly Windows Toolbox) (MicroWin component)](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil)

### Follow my work
I also focus on software reports on BetaWiki, mostly of Visual Studio versions, but also of other software products. Check out my contributions to this amazing site [here](https://betawiki.net/wiki/Special:Contributions/BetaReporter).

I have recently begun archiving stuff to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/@betareporter) as well!

*PS: get ready to experience turtle-like download speeds! (not a blame on me, but on the IA)*

### Contact
If you want to talk about something related to software development or technology, contact me via [e-mail](mailto:betareporter98@gmail.com). Any topic other than those 2 will not have the same priority and (in some cases) it may be discarded.
